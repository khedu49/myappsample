1. Our services 
Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together to get work and to find talent in the media related industry. To help advance this mission, we provide the products and services described below to you: 
Provide a personalised experience for you:
Your experience on Step2Fame is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads and other content that you see in Dashboard or our video platform to the Pages that you follow and other features that you might use, such as Trending and search. We use the data that we have – for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products – to personalise your experience. 
Connect you with people and organisations that you want to work with:
We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that matter to you across the Step2Fame Products that you use. We use the data that we have to make suggestions for you and others – for example, send a message to, jobs or projects to watch for and people or organization who you may want to work with. Stronger ties make for better opportunities, and we believe that our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organisations that they want to work with. 

Empower you to project yourself and find the kind of work that matters to you:
There are many ways to project yourself on Step2Fame and to communicate with media agencies, production houses and print media and others about you – for example, sharing photos, videos and stories across the Step2Fame Products that you use, sending messages to several people, creating project or groups, or adding content to your profile. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Step2Fame. 
Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you:
We show you ads, offers and other sponsored content to help you discover content, products and services that are offered by the many businesses and organisations that use Step2Fame and other Step2Fame Products. Our partners pay us to show their content to you, and we design our services so that the sponsored content you see is as relevant and useful to you as everything else that you see on our Products. 

Combat harmful conduct, and protect and support our community:
People will only build projects or profiles on Step2Fame if they feel safe. We employ dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our members. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take appropriate action – for example, offering help, removing content, blocking access to certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data with other Step2Fame Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products. 
Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:
We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology such as this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Step2Fame. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products. 

Research ways to make our services better:
We engage in research and collaborate with others to improve our Products. One way we do this is by analysing the data we have and understanding how people use our Products. 
Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Step2Fame Company Products:
Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations, media houses, ad agencies, production houses and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different Step2Fame Company Products that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on Step2Fame to make it easier for you to connect with them, and we enable you to communicate with businesses that you follow on Step2Fame. 

Enable global access to our services:
To operate our global service, we need to store and distribute content and data in our data centres and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. This infrastructure may be operated or controlled by Step2Fame, Inc., Firebase technologies or others. 
2. Our Data Policy and your privacy choices

Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products. 
We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the Step2Fame community, you can delete your account at any time. 

2. Account suspension or termination
We want Step2Fame to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to search work for themselves and share their portfolios. 
If we determine that you have breached our terms or policies, we may take action against your account to protect our community and services, including by suspending access to your account or disabling it. We may also suspend or disable your account if you create risk or legal exposure for us or when we are permitted or required to do so by law. Where appropriate, we will notify you about your account the next time you try to access it. 
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain in place: 3, 4.2-4.5 

3. Limits on liability
We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are provided "as is", and we make no guarantees that they will always be safe, secure or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content that they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful and other objectionable content). 
We cannot predict when issues may arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstances will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the Step2Fame Products, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. 
4. Disputes
We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply. 
If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us, which arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Step2Fame Products ("claim"), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the District Court of Mumbai/Maharashtra or a state court located in Mumbai, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of Maharashtra will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our Music Guidelines. To the extent that any supplemental Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.
3.	If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
4.	You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our consent.
5.	You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialised. Only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account after it is memorialised.
6.	These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
7.	You should know that we may need to change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name that you use in everyday life).

Device information.
As described below, we collect information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different devices that you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our Products on your phone to better personalise the content (including ads) or features that you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad that we showed you on your phone on a different device. 

Information that we obtain from these devices includes: 


•	Device attributes: information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.
•	Device operations: information about operations and behaviours performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from bots).
•	Identifiers: unique identifiers, device IDs and other identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts that you use, and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to Step2Fame (Graviton Media Tech Company Products) associated with the same device or account).
•	Device signals: Bluetooth signals, information about nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons and mobile phone masts.
•	Data from device settings: information that you allow us to receive through device settings that you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera or photos.
•	Network and connections: information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things such as help you stream a video from your phone to your TV.
•	Cookie data: data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Step2Fame Cookies Policy and Instagram Cookies Policy.


Information from partners.
Advertisers, app developers and publishers can send us information through Step2Fame Business Tools that they use, including our social plugins (such as the Like button), Step2Fame Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Step2Fame pixel. These partners provide information about your activities off Step2Fame – including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you make, the ads you see and how you use their services – whether or not you have a Step2Fame account or are logged in to Step2Fame. For example, a game developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could tell us about a purchase you made in its shop. We also receive information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have the rights to provide us with your information. 

Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services, or through third parties that they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing us with any data.  

To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Step2Fame Business Tools, review the Step2Fame Cookie Policy. 

How do we use this information?
We use the information that we have (subject to choices you make) as described below, and to provide and support the Step2Fame Products and related services described in the Step2Fame Terms. Here's how: 
Provide, personalise and improve our Products.
We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to personalise features and content (including your Projects  and ads) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or upcoming projects you may be interested in or project you may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalised Products that are unique and relevant to you, we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the data that we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products; and the people, places or things that you're connected to and interested in on and off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to personalise your Step2Fame experience, including features, content and recommendations in Step2Fame Products; you can also learn more about how we choose the adsthat you see. 
•	Information across Step2Fame Products and devices: We connect information about your activities on different Step2Fame Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Step2Fame Products that you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that you apply a job post on Step2Fame. We can also make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from one Step2Fame Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product.
•	Location-related information: We use location-related information – such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near – to provide, personalise and improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related information can be based on things such as precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect it), IP addresses and information from your and others' use of Step2Fame Products (such as check-ins or work you attend).
•	Product research and development: We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features.
•	Ads and other sponsored content:We use the information we have about you – including information about your interests, actions and connections – to select and personalise ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and personalise ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the Step2Fame Settings.

Provide measurement, analytics and other business services.
We use the information that we have (including your activity off our Products, such as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services, and understand the types of people who use their services and how people interact with their websites, apps and services. 

Promote safety, integrity and security.
We use the information that we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off Step2Fame Products. For example, we use data that we have to investigate suspicious activity or breaches of our Terms or Policies, or to detect when someone needs help. 

Communicate with you.
We use the information that we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Products and let you know about our Policies and Terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us. 

How is this information shared?
Your information is shared with others in the following ways: 


Sharing on Step2Fame Products
People and accounts that you share and communicate with
When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Step2Fame, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public or a customised list of people. Similarly, when you communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions that you have taken on our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has viewed their Step2Fame profile. 

Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This includes your username, any information you share with a public audience, information in your public profile on Step2Fame, and content you share on a Step2Fame Page or any other public forum. You, other people using Step2Fame, and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Step2Fame or Graviton Media tech Company Products, in search results or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs and offline media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products. 


Content that others share or reshare about you.
You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience that you shared with. For example, when you share a project or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later. 

People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can choose to stop the user from sharing the content. 

Information about your active status or presence on our Products.
People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently active on Step2Fame, or when you last used our Products. 
Apps, websites and third-party integrations on or using our Products.
When you choose to use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Step2Fame friends or use a Step2Fame Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Step2Fame. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on Step2Fame, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites that you use may receive your list of Step2Fame contacts if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites that you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Step2Fame contacts from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one. 

Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Step2Fame (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information that you choose to share with them, including information that your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you. 

Note: We are in the process of restricting developers' data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your Step2Fame data if you haven't used their app in three months, and we are changing login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.

New owner.
If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner. 


Sharing with third-party partners
We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Step2Fame Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties that we share information with: 

Partners who use our analytics services.
We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Step2Fame Products. For example, Page admins profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, applied to their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or account. 
Advertisers.
We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Mumbai and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Step2Fame ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser. 

Measurement partners.
We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners. 
Partners offering goods and services in our Products.
When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public information and other information that you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details. 

Vendors and service providers.
We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analysing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys. 
Researchers and academics.
We also provide information and content to research partners and academics to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that supports our business or mission and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being. 

Law enforcement or legal requests.
We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below. 

Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-party partners in the Step2Fame settings.
How do the Step2Fame Companies work together? 
Step2Fame share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Step2Fame Companies (which may include any apps or websites launched by Graviton Media Tech in the future or that is live today) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Step2Fame or Graviton Media Tech Company Products that you use. We also process information about you across the Step2Fame Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their Terms and Policies. For example, we process information from Step2fame about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Step2Fame or any other apps or website created and handled by Graviton Media Tech. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Step2Fame Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Step2Fame Company Products. 
How can I manage or delete information about me? 
We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and delete your data. Learn more in your Step2Fame settings. 

We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Step2Fame Products or until your account is deleted – whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Step2Fame, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after six months. If you submit a copy of your valid photo ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content that you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins. 

When you delete your account, we delete things that you have posted, such as your photos, videos and personal details and you won't be able to recover this information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the Step2Fame settings. 
How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm? 
We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others: 
•	In response to a legal request (e.g. a search warrant, court order) if we have a good-faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions within/outside of India when we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction and is consistent with internationally recognised standards.
•	When we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorised use of the Products, breaches of our Terms or Policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory enquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.
Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Step2Fame) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation or investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for term breaches for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term breaches. 
How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services? 
We share information globally, both internally within the Step2Fame Companies, and externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this Policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in and outside India or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this Policy. These data transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the Step2Fame Terms, and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilise standard contract clauses, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to India and other countries. 
How will we notify you of changes to this Policy?
We'll notify you before we make changes to this Policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised Policy before you choose to continue using our Products.
